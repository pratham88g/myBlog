<p> My hobby is reading books in my free time. I enjoy reading different books of different genre. Books are a source of enjoyment, inspiration, knowledge and instruction. I am 12 years old and I am in 6th grade and I read books of space, reaserch, adventure and mystery. I love reading my books and they thrill me a lot. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in life. </p>
